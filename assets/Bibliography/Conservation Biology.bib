abstract = {One of the most challenging fauna to study in situ is the obligate cave fauna because of the difficulty of sampling. Cave-limited species display patchy and restricted distributions, but it is often unclear whether the observed distribution is a sampling artifact or a true restriction in range. Further, the drivers of the distribution could be local environmental conditions, such as cave humidity, or they could be associated with surface features that are surrogates for cave conditions. If surface features can be used to predict the distribution of important cave taxa, then conservation management is more easily obtained. We examined the hypothesis that the presence of major faunal groups of cave obligate species could be predicted based on features of the earth surface. Georeferenced records of cave obligate amphipods, crayfish, fish, isopods, beetles, millipedes, pseudoscorpions, spiders, and springtails within the area of Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative in the eastern United States (Illinois to Virginia and New York to Alabama) were assigned to 20 x 20 km grid cells. Habitat suitability for these faunal groups was modeled using logistic regression with twenty predictor variables within each grid cell, such as percent karst, soil features, temperature, precipitation, and elevation. Models successfully predicted the presence of a group greater than 65{\%} of the time (mean = 88{\%}) for the presence of single grid cell endemics, and for all faunal groups except pseudoscorpions. The most common predictor variables were latitude, percent karst, and the standard deviation of the Topographic Position Index (TPI), a measure of landscape rugosity within each grid cell. The overall success of these models points to a number of important connections between the surface and cave environments, and some of these, especially soil features and topographic variability, suggest new research directions. These models should prove to be useful tools in predicting the presence of species in understudied areas.},

abstract = {In the present paper we identify biodiversity hotspots of endemic terrestrial invertebrates in southern Greece, using four different criteria and five taxonomic groups. The hotspots identification pro- cedure was facilitated by the use of the MapInfoPro G.I.S. software. We mapped the known distribution of 424 endemic species on a digital map of southern Greece in 548 10× 10 km2 grids. The total number of registrations (records per grid) is 3826 in 465 grids. Registrations are unevenly distributed in the five sub-regions of the study area, a fact that results fromboth the unequal collecting effort applied in each sub- region and their different levels of endemism.We first identified the hotspots for each individual taxonomic group, and then for the total species pool. Finally, we analyzed the species saturation pattern in order to find the minimum number of grids needed for the inclusion of 85{\%} of the total number of species. The most important hotspots are mostly at the higher mountains of the study area, especially on Taygetos and IdiMts.We also give a brief evaluation of the performance of the four criteria used in the case of endemic species analyses.},

abstract = {We compare different null models for species richness patterns in the Nepalese Himalayas, the largest altitudinal gradient in the world. Species richness is estimated by interpolation of presences between the extreme recorded altitudinal ranges. The number of species in 100-m altitudinal bands increases steeply with altitude until 1,500 m above sea level. Between 1,500 and 2,500 m, little change in the number of species is observed, but above this altitude, a decrease in species richness is evident. We simulate different null models to investigate the effect of hard boundaries and an assumed linear relationship between species richness and altitude. We also stimulate the effect of interpolation when incomplete sampling is assumed. Some modifications on earlier simulations are presented. We demonstrate that all three factors in combination may explain the observed pattern in species richness. Estimating species richness by interpolating species presence between maximum and minimum altitudes creates an artificially steep decrease in species richness toward the ends of the gradient. The addition of hard boundaries and an underlying linear trend in species richness is needed to simulate the observed broad pattern in species richness along altitude in the Nepalese Himalayas.},

abstract = {The world's governments have committed to preventing the extinction of threatened species and improving their conservation status by 2020. However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed across space, and neither are the drivers of its decline, and so different regions face very different challenges. Here, we quantify the contribution of regions and countries towards recent global trends in vertebrate conservation status (as measured by the Red List Index), to guide action towards the 2020 target. We found that{\textgreater}50{\%} of the global deterioration in the conservation status of birds, mammals and amphibians is concentrated in {\textless}1{\%} of the surface area, 39/1098 ecoregions (4{\%}) and eight/195 countries (4{\%}) - Australia, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. These countries hold a third of global diversity in these vertebrate groups, partially explaining why they concentrate most of the losses. Yet, other megadiverse countries - most notably Brazil (responsible for 10{\%} of species but just 1{\%} of deterioration), plus India and Madagascar - performed better in conserving their share of global vertebrate diversity. Very few countries, mostly island nations (e.g. Cook Islands, Fiji, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Tonga), have achieved net improvements. Per capita wealth does not explain these patterns, with two of the richest countries - United States and Australia - fairing conspicuously poorly. Different countries were affected by different combinations of threats. Reducing global rates of biodiversity loss will require investment in the regions and countries with the highest responsibility for the world's biodiversity, focusing on conserving those species and areas most in peril and on reducing the drivers with the highest impacts.},

abstract = {Biodiversity data derive from myriad sources stored in various formats on many distinct hardware and software platforms. An essential step towards understanding global patterns of biodiversity is to provide a standardized view of these heterogeneous data sources to improve interoperability. Fundamental to this advance are definitions of common terms. This paper describes the evolution and development of Darwin Core, a data standard for publishing and integrating biodiversity information. We focus on the categories of terms that define the standard, differences between simple and relational Darwin Core, how the standard has been implemented, and the community processes that are essential for maintenance and growth of the standard. We present case-study extensions of the Darwin Core into new research communities, including metagenomics and genetic resources. We close by showing how Darwin Core records are integrated to create new knowledge products documenting species distributions and changes due to environmental perturbations.},

abstract = {SPECIES conservation in situ requires networks of protected areas selected for high conservation interest1-3. Throughout most of the world, however, there are neither the resources nor the time to carry out detailed inventories for most taxa2,4 before designating protected areas. Site selection (on grounds other than availability) would be easier and more effective if two things were true: (1) habitats that are species-rich for one taxon are also species-rich for others5; and (2) rare1 species occur in, and therefore benefit from the conservation of, species-rich habitats. Diversity (usually, species richness) and the presence of rare species are the most frequently cited criteria for site selection by conservationists6-8. Here, we use data on British plants and animals held by the Biological Records Centre (BRC)9 and the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), mapped on a grid of 10 km x 10 km ('10 km squares') to examine the extent to which species-rich areas for different taxa coincide, and whether species-rich areas contain substantial numbers of rare species. The fine scale and high intensity of recording in Britain produces distributional datasets at least as good as and, in most cases, better than those available elsewhere. For Britain at least, we do not find strong support for either proposition. Species-rich areas ('hotspots'10) frequently do not coincide for different taxa, and many rare species do not occur in the most species-rich squares.},

We identify seven impediments to their effective protection: (1) invertebrates and their ecological services are mostly unknown to the general public (the public dilemma); (2) policymakers and stakeholders are mostly unaware of invertebrate conservation problems (the political dilemma); (3) basic science on invertebrates is scarce and underfunded (the scientific dilemma); (4) most species are undescribed (the Linnean shortfall); (5) the distribution of described species is mostly unknown (the Wallacean shortfall); (6) the abundance of species and their changes in space and time are unknown (the Prestonian shortfall); (7) species ways of life and sensitivities to habitat change are largely unknown (the Hutchinsonian shortfall).Numerous recent developments in taxonomy, inventorying, monitoring, data compilation, statistical analysis and science communication facilitate overcoming these impediments in both policy and practice. We suggest as possible solutions for the public dilemma: better public information and marketing. For the political dilemma: red-listing, legal priority listing and inclusion in environmental impact assessment studies. For the scientific dilemma: parataxonomy, citizen science programs and biodiversity informatics. For the Linnean shortfall: biodiversity surrogacy, increased support for taxonomy and advances in taxonomic publications. For the Wallacean shortfall: funding of inventories, compilation of data in public repositories and species distribution modeling. For the Prestonian shortfall: standardized protocols for inventorying and monitoring, widespread use of analogous protocols and increased support for natural history collections. For the Hutchinsonian shortfall: identifying good indicator taxa and studying extinction rates by indirect evidence. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biodiversity hotspots have a prominent role in conservation biology, but it remains controversial to what extent different types of hotspot are congruent. Previous studies were unable to provide a general answer because they used a single biodiversity index, were geographically restricted, compared areas of unequal size or did not quantitatively compare hotspot types. Here we use a new global database on the breeding distribution of all known extant bird species to test for congruence across three types of hotspot. We demonstrate that hotspots of species richness, threat and endemism do not show the same geographical distribution. Only 2.5{\%} of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80{\%} of hotspots being idiosyncratic. More generally, there is a surprisingly low overall congruence of biodiversity indices, with any one index explaining less than 24{\%} of variation in the other indices. These results suggest that, even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of different aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.},

This content downloaded from 193.63.37.89 on Thu, SUMMARY (1) The numbers of species of insects feeding on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum(L.) Kuhn.) were recorded at 213 sites at different altitudes throughout mainland Britain. Herbivore species richness and abandance were also recorded in five detailed altitudinal transects of the North Yorkshire Moors. (2) Only one species, the delphacid bug Ditropispteridis (Spin.), had a distribution that was clearly and consistently linked with altitude. As altitude increased, it occurred at fewer sites and became less abundant at occupied sites. (3) Ditropis was introduced in two consecutive years onto bracken above its normal altitudinal range. It reproduced successfully over the summer, but failed to overwinter, possibly because it could not synchronize its life-history with delayed emergence of bracken fronds in the spring at high altitudes. (4) Unlike the results of other similar studies, the total number of species of bracken herbivores did not decline with altitude. As a resource for its insect herbivores, bracken is relatively similar (though not identical) at all altitudes. We were also able to control for a number of other habitat variables that may influence insect species richness over altitudinal gradients (e.g. declining host-plant species richness and reduced habitat area at high altitudes). Therefore, these other variables, rather than increasing environmental harshness, may be primarily responsible for the decline in insect species richness that is often observed with increasing altitude.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial freshwater and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in "established use." Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},
